# Electric curtain

Controller: NodeMCU DEVKIT 1.0

- three functionalities: open, close, stop
- simulated by using two FauxMo devices
  - curtain opener: on = open curtain,  off = stop
  - curtain closer: on = close curtain, off = stop
- original controller had 4 buttons: open, close, and 2 buttons for stop. All buttons are active-low (possibly pulled high by a pull-up resistor), logic level = 5V.

## To-Do
- [ ] add schematic and photos?
